# Java

It will be about [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.


## Example

A simple 'Hello world' program in Java would be:

```Java
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
